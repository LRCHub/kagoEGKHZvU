Don't talk to me, just keep on stepping to the beat
With you here by my side nowhere I'd rather be (yeah)
Now time is stoppin' like the hand of a clock
Feel like we're locked in, stuck inside this messy room
It's never changing, just a scene inside my mind
Memories of you and me keep passing by (ah)
Let's take it back now, when the needle drops
Let's play it back now, 'cause the music never stops
Don't need a change, yeah
Just stay the same, yeah
Lookin' back, the only one I saw was you
All the words we don't say
And the look on your face
Yeah, I know it's best we keep it this way, maybe
And our time's running out
So just breathe it all out
'Cause for now, there's nothing more for us to say
So baby
Don't talk to me, just keep on stepping to the beat
With you here by my side nowhere I'd rather be (dance with me)
Don't talk to me, just wanna feel your energy
Ah, let's dance the night away
Tu-tu-lu-tu-lu
Now you're shining, see the light on your skin
And when you're smiling, something 'bout that little grin
Don't ever change, yeah
Just stay the same, yeah
And for now, don't let the moment pass us by, ya ah
Every time you look at me
I can feel the memories
Stirring up in my heart like coffee
And every word you said to me
Replays like a melody
Before I let you go
Dance with me
Don't talk to me, just keep on stepping to the beat
With you here by my side nowhere I'd rather be (dance with me)
Don't talk to me, just wanna feel your energy
Ah, let's dance the night away
Tu-tu-lu-tu-lu
Dancing in the darkness
Don't let it end tonight
Someone tell the DJ don't stop the music
Stay here by my side
We can dance all night
I don't care if I see tomorrow one more time
Don't talk to me, just keep on stepping to the beat
With you here by my side nowhere I'd rather be (dance with me)
Don't talk to me, just wanna feel your energy
Ah, ah, I just need your lovin'
Don't talk to me, just keep on stepping to the beat
With you here by my side where I wanna be (dance with me)
Don't talk to me, just wanna feel your energy
Ah, let's dance the night away
